Additional decimal places past one are not needed. The game only tracks/is accurate to the hundredths place.

Included are settings to also remove the separator ("." or ",") as well as the unit, making the indicator virtually a tick counter. There is also an option for one _less_ decimal place (works well with Save My Tick!)

This mod patches LanguageManager.GetTimeStringForCurrentLanguage
Should be compatible; haven't seen other mods edit this.
